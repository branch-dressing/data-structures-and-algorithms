# Reverse an Array
<!-- Takes an array and returns the same array but reverse. It does not use the .reverse method -->

## Challenge
<!-- It asked us to give the reverse array... -->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- I chose a for loop, set i to the total length, abnd then subtracted 1 each time, pushing the new index into a new array-->


# Add value to middle of array
<!-- Takes an array and a value and returns a new array with the value added to the middle-->

## Challenge
<!-- Don't use any method that lives on arrays -->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- I built upon the function from 'reverse an array' code challenge, and then wrote an if statement when I wanted to add the new value. I don't feel it's that efficient. I could probably do some refactoring. -->


# Array Binary Search
<!-- Takes array and search value, returns index of searched item -->

## Challenge
<!-- Don't use those array methods!-->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- Set the return index to a default of -1, looped through an the array checking if each item was the searched key. If it was I set the returned index to the current index in the loop then broke out of the loop-->


# Linked List and Doubly Linked List
<!-- Create a linked list. Stretch: create doubly linked list -->

## Challenge
<!-- Just learning to create linked list-->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- Spent a lot of time looking up what a linked list was and how it work. From there I wrote out and tested Node class and Linked List class piece by piece until I found I had a better understanding of what they were and what they did.
To add the doubly linked list, I had to go to the next node (if it existed) and modify it there.-->
