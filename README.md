# Reverse an Array
<!-- Takes an array and returns the same array but reverse. It does not use the .reverse method -->

## Challenge
<!-- It asked us to give the reverse array... -->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- I chose a for loop, set i to the total length, abnd then subtracted 1 each time, pushing the new index into a new array-->



# Array Binary Search
<!-- Takes array and search value, returns index of searched item -->

## Challenge
<!-- Don't use those array methods!-->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- Set the return index to a default of -1, looped through an the array checking if each item was the searched key. If it was I set the returned index to the current index in the loop then broke out of the loop-->
