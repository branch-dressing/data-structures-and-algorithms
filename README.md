# Reverse an Array
<!-- Takes an array and returns the same array but reverse. It does not use the .reverse method -->

## Challenge
<!-- It asked us to give the reverse array... -->

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- I chose a for loop, set i to the total length, abnd then subtracted 1 each time, pushing the new index into a new array-->
